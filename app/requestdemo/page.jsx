This page is using a [Netlify Edge Function](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/overview/) to rewrite the URL based on visitor geography.

For it to be invoked, please either run this site locally with \`netlify dev\` or deploy it to Netlify.

Edge Functions are framework-agnostic, but are also used behind the scenes to run Next.js Middleware on Netlify.
There are advatanges to using Edge Functions directly, such as the ability to access & transform the response body.

[See more examples](https://edge-functions-examples.netlify.app)
